            <h4><b>Situated in the heart of Pune in Shaniwar Peth, the 17th century Omkareshwar Temple is a synonym of the rich Maratha culture and heritage.
                The temple was built by Chimaji Appa, a commander of the Maratha Empire and Peshwa Bajirao between 1740 to 1760 on the banks of Mutha river. 
                Other than being a shire to Lord Shiva, the temple also has the samadhi of Chimaji Appa which makes this sacred space even more alluring for the visitors. 
                It is also believed that Annapurna, Chimaji Appaâ€™s wife had committed Sati in this very premises after his death in 1741.
