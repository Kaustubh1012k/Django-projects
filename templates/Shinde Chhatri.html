            <h4><b>Mahadaji Shinde Chhatri is a memorial dedicated to the 18th century Maratha military leader Mahadji Shinde who served as the commander-in-chief of the Maratha army under the Peshwas from 1760 to 1780.
                It is one of the most significant landmarks in the city and is reminiscent of the Maratha rule.
                It is a hall that marks the spot of Mahadji Shinde's cremation on 12 February 1794.
                In 1794, the complex of the memorial only had a temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, which was built by Mahadji Shinde himself. 
                He died the same year and his last rites were performed in the premises.
                In 1910, a samadhi (memorial) was constructed outside the sanctum of the Shiva temple, in memory of Mahadji Shinde, exactly where he was cremated. Maharaja Madho Rao Scindia of Gwalior (1876 â€“ 1925) commissioned the building of the complex, along with the memorial of Mahadji Shinde.
                The major attraction of the Shinde Chhatri of Pune is its exquisite architecture, reflecting the style used in Rajasthan, India.
                The Anglo-Rajasthani style of construction exhibits a fine blending of two different cultures.
