            <h4><b>The Lal Mahal (Red Palace) of Pune is one of the most famous monuments located in Pune, India, where Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, founder of the Maratha Empire spent his childhood.
                In the year 1630 AD, Shivaji Maharaj's Father Shahaji Raje Bhosale, established the Lal Mahal for his wife Jijabai and son. 
                Shivaji Maharaj stayed here for several years until he captured his first fort. The current Lal Mahal is a reconstruction of the original and located in the center of the Pune city. The original Lal Mahal was built with the idea of rejuvenating the recently razed city of Pune when Shahaji Raje entered the city along with Shivaji and his mother, Maasaheb Jijabai.
                Young Shivaji Maharaj grew up here, and stayed in the Lal Mahal till he captured the Torna fort in 1645. 
                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's marriage with his first wife, Saibai took place in Lal Mahal on 16 May 1640.
